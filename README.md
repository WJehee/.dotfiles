# dotfiles

My dotfiles, currently under construction.
To be used with GNU stow.

## Usage

- Clone this repository into your home folder
- Change directory into this folder
- Optionally remove the README file
- Run stow (name of program you want the configs for, or simply * to do all of them)
- They will automatically be placed in the right location!
